== Java EE 8 and Jakarta EE 8 Comparison
=== Java EE 8 and Jakarta EE 8 Specification Comparisons
The intent of this section is to explain any differences in specification names and versions between those referenced in the last Java EE 8 Platform specification, dated July 31st, 2017 and the Jakarta EE 8 Platform specification.

In some cases the versions changed in preparation for contribution and therefore the official JCP versions changed over those referenced in the July 31st, 2017 Platform specification.  In other cases the versions were changed after the contribution.  This section explains both sets of changes and encompasses all specifications contributed.

It is important to understand that despite any name or version changes, Java EE 8 and Jakarta EE 8 are functionally equivalent.

==== Transaction 1.2 vs 1.3

To address cleanly separating the `javax.transaction` package in Java™ SE from the classes being contributed, a Maintenance Release of the Java™ Transaction API (JTA) was created in the JCP and released as https://jcp.org/aboutJava/communityprocess/maintenance/jsr907/JTA1.3MR-November2017.pdf[version 1.3].  The official Jakarta version is therefore 1.3 and not 1.2.

No API changes were made in this Maintenance Release or after contribution and Java™ Transaction API 1.2, Java™ Transaction API 1.3 and Jakarta Transactions 1.3 are functionally equivalent.

==== Deployment 1.2 vs 1.7

The last Maintenance Release of JSR-88 Java™ EE Application Deployment in the JCP is version 1.2.  After contribution and before completion of the Jakarta EE Specification Process a version 1.7 was released under the `jakarta` groupId in efforts to ship a Java EE 8 certified version of Eclipse GlassFish.

The mistaken change from 1.2 to 1.7 was discovered while following the completed Jakarta EE Specification Process.  The Specification Committee decided to leave the version as 1.7 to avoid any potential future version conflicts.

Java™ EE Application Deployment 1.2 and Jakarta™ Deployment 1.7 are functionally equivalent.

==== Concurrency 1.0 vs 1.1

The last official release of JSR 236: Concurrency Utilities for JavaTM EE was 1.0.  A version 1.1 was published under the `javax` groupId in Feb 2018 and again as 1.1 under the `jakarta` groupId in Jan 2019 for the previously mentioned Java EE 8 certified version of Eclipse GlassFish.

The mistaken change from 1.0 to 1.1 was discovered while following the Jakarta EE Specification Process and, as with Deployment, the Specification Committee decided to leave the version 1.1 to avoid future version conflicts.

Concurrency Utilities for Java EE 1.0 and Jakarta Concurrency 1.1 are functionally equivalent.

=== Java EE 8 Specification References

The following table lists specifications contributed to Eclipse but not included in Jakarta EE 8.
These specifications are a part of Java SE 8 but are being removed from later versions of
Java SE as described in https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/320[JEP 320]. These specifications are an important part of the Jakarta EE
platform and will be considered for inclusion in a version of Jakarta EE that targets versions of
Java SE where they have been removed.

====  Activation 1.1 vs 1.2

The Java EE 8 Platform specification, dated July 31st, 2017, references JavaBeans™ Activation Framework Specification Version 1.1 in appendix EE.C Related Documents.
A Maintenance Release of the JavaBeans™ Activation Framework was created and released in the JCP as version 1.2 dated July 2017.
JavaBeans Activation Framework 1.2 adds support for, and is included in, Java SE 9, and is the version contributed to Eclipse.

====  SOAP with Attachments 1.3 vs 1.4

The Java EE 8 Platform specification, dated July 31st, 2017, references SOAP with Attachments API for Java™ Version 1.3 in appendix EE.C Related Documents.
A Maintenance Release of the SOAP with Attachments API for Java™ was created and released as version 1.4 dated July 2017.
The reference to SOAP with Attachments API for Java™ Version 1.3 in the Java EE 8 Platform specification, released at the same time was simply an error, and it should have referenced version 1.4.
